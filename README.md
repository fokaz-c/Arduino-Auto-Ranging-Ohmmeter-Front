# Arduino-Auto-Ranging-Ohmmeter
This project implements an auto-ranging ohmmeter to measure resistance values automatically and display them in real-time both on an LCD screen and in a web browser. The Arduino uses the voltage divider technique to calculate the unknown resistance value, with multiple resistor ranges automatically selected via electronic switches (transistors).
